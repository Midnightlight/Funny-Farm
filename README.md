# FUNNY FARM
## Case description
- A friend of mine is an entrepreneur working in Vietnamese food and farming who needs an online market website to sell his products. 
- This project was done as a demo platform helping him and other food and farming entrepreneurs with similar needs.


## Actors of the solution
- There are three parties in the application: Buyer, Seller and Platform owner. 
- The sellers can post their items to the platform. The buyers can search in the platform for needed products from nearby and trustworthy sellers. To use the platform, the sellers need to pay a monthly / annually fee to Platform owner.


## Data input and output
- The sellers can submit a post that contains the product’s name, description, price, images and location to pick-up (or shipping price and area).
- The buyers can search for their needed products by querying product’s name, price range and area (to-be-improved: the app retrieves the user’s GPS coordinate and displayed nearby results).

Please have a look: [Heroku App](https://funny-farm-frontend.herokuapp.com/). The backend is also hosted in Heroku so it might take a while for contents to load.
